      "{'article': '(CNN)The attorney for a suburban New York cardiologist charged in what authorities say was a failed scheme to have another physician hurt or killed is calling the allegations against his client \"completely unsubstantiated.\" Appearing Saturday morning on CNN\\'s \"New Day,\" Randy Zelin defended his client, Dr. Anthony Moschetto, who faces criminal solicitation, conspiracy, burglary, arson, criminal prescription sale and weapons charges in connection to what prosecutors called a plot to take out a rival doctor on Long Island. \"None of anything in this case has any evidentiary value,\" Zelin told CNN\\'s Christi Paul.  \"It doesn\\'t matter what anyone says, he is presumed to be innocent.\" Moschetto,54, pleaded not guilty to all charges Wednesday.  He was released after posting $2 million bond and surrendering his passport. Zelin said that his next move is to get Dr. Moshetto back to work. \"He\\'s got patients to see. This man, while he was in a detention cell, the only thing that he cared about were his patients. And amazingly, his patients were flooding the office with calls, making sure that he was OK,\" Zelin said. Two other men -- identified as James Chmela, 43, and James Kalamaras, 41 -- were named as accomplices, according to prosecutors. They pleaded not guilty in Nassau County District Court, according to authorities. Both were released on bail. A requests for comment from an attorney representing Chmela was not returned. It\\'s unclear whether Kalamaras has retained an attorney. Police officers allegedly discovered approximately 100 weapons at Moschetto\\'s home, including hand grenades, high-capacity magazines and knives. Many of the weapons were found in a hidden room behind a switch-activated bookshelf, according to prosecutors. The investigation began back in December, when undercover officers began buying heroin and oxycodone pills from Moschetto in what was initially a routine investigation into the sale of prescription drugs, officials said. During the course of the undercover operation, however, Moschetto also sold the officers two semiautomatic assault weapons as well as ammunition, prosecutors said. Moschetto allegedly told officers during one buy that he needed dynamite to \"blow up a building.\" He later said he no longer needed the dynamite because a friend was setting fire to the building instead. Kalamaras and Chmela are believed to have taken part in the arson, according to prosecutors. \"The fire damaged but did not destroy the office of another cardiologist whose relationship with Dr. Moschetto had soured due to a professional dispute,\" according to the statement from the district attorney\\'s office. Moschetto allegedly gave an informant and undercover detective blank prescriptions and cash for the assault and killing of the fellow cardiologist, according to prosecutors. He also requested that the rival\\'s wife be assaulted if she happened to be present, authorities said. \"He was willing to pay $5,000 to have him beaten and put in a hospital for a few months, and then he said he would pay $20,000 to have him killed,\" said Assistant District Attorney Anne Donnelly, according to CNN affiliate WCBS.', 'highlights': 'A lawyer for Dr. Anthony Moschetto says the charges against him are baseless .\\nMoschetto, 54, was arrested for selling drugs and weapons, prosecutors say .\\nAuthorities allege Moschetto hired accomplices to burn down the practice of former associate .', 'id': '0021fe8d65bd0d6d76d5fefba2ac02f0c48a43f4'}\n",
      "{'article': '(CNN)When the earthquake hit, many of Nepal\\'s most renowned pagodas in and around Kathmandu crumbled into rubble-covered stumps. Others were smothered under splintered hand-carved wooden beams or multi-level rooftops. But the Kathmandu Valley\\'s other pagodas, stupas and shrines -- also built mostly of red brick hundreds of years ago -- suffered surprisingly little damage and remained standing next to  structures which disappeared. The worst architectural losses have included the majestic Shiva temple pagoda and its twin, the Narayan temple pagoda, which dominated Kathmandu\\'s main Durbar Square. From the late 1960s onwards, Western hippy backpackers who traveled the legendary overland route to Kathmandu would climb the Shiva pagoda\\'s wide, nine-step plinth, sit in the shade under the triple-layered roofs, smoke hashish and enjoy the lofty view. But now the two pagodas have been obliterated and the scene comprises pathetic piles of rubble, a bulldozer shoveling a path for vehicles, shocked and miserable witnesses and a sense of irreplaceable visual and spiritual loss -- unless the structures are eventually rebuilt. The Shiva temple pagoda may have been hundreds of years old, but before its destruction impoverished rickshaw drivers, coolies and others would publicly urinate into the gutter surrounding it while waiting for passengers or heavy loads to transport. The slightly shorter, triple-roofed Narayan pagoda allowed vegetable sellers to display their foodstuff on the temple\\'s broad, five-level base. Both pagodas also served as public platforms. Jostling crowds of Nepalis and foreigners used to gather there because the plinths\\' height above street level allowed excellent views of major Hindu processions and other events. Those two landmarks fronted the enclosed dwelling place of Nepal\\'s Hindu virgin goddess, or Kumari, whose ornate front of bricks, statues and carved wood seem to have survived the initial quakes. It is not immediately known if the inner courtyard and rooms are safe. On the other side of Durbar Square, the brick-and-wood Shiva-Parvati temple house -- where the Hindu gods Shiva and his consort Parvati shelter -- appear to also have survived. On Kathmandu\\'s outskirts the town of Patan suffered terrible damage when its central Durbar Square lost several pagodas as structures pancaked straight down while others merely shook and cracked. Fortunately others appear to still be standing, including the Sundari Chowk temple and a surviving lucky trio of holy structures: the gray stone, Mogul-influenced Krishna Mandir; the 17th-century Bishwa Nath Mandir with its large stone elephants at the entrance; and the nearby smaller 17th-century Bimsen Mandi \"god of the traders\" pagoda. Several miles away from Kathmandu, witnesses have been unable to immediately confirm the levels of destruction which have occurred in the lavish town of Bhaktapur. The locality had undergone years of extensive restoration work thanks to foreign and local artists and funding. The town offset some of that cost by charging tourists a fee to enter its central area, which displayed refined temples, pagodas, shrines and even a restaurant built into a main pagoda, allowing diners to view the best sites while munching their meals. Elsewhere in the Kathmandu Valley, the white-topped dome of the Boudhanath Stupa remains standing, but its smaller neighboring stupa has shown some damage from the quake. The Boudhanath Stupa is prized by Tibetan Buddhist refugees who have fled their Chinese-occupied homeland on foot through the Himalaya mountains. They are often seen reverently walking in a circle around the stupa\\'s base while twirling \"prayer wheels\" and chanting. There has been no news as yet on damage caused to other famous places of Hindu and Buddhist worship, including the hilltop Swayambhunath temple on the outskirts of Kathmandu. That imposing structure is popularly known as the \"Monkey Temple\" because its often vicious wild monkeys are allowed to scamper among the trees on the temple\\'s hill, terrifying visitors who have to hike up a lengthy stairway to reach the temples, shrines, shops and monks\\' residences.. The fate of the Pashupatinath Temple complex near Kathmandu\\'s international airport is also not known. Pashupatinath\\'s multiple pagodas and shrines flank its public funeral pyres which emit smoke whenever human corpses are routinely cremated before the ashes are dumped into a narrow river.', 'highlights': \"Several of Nepal's best known landmarks have been destroyed by the earthquake of April 25 .\\nBut outside the capital Kathmandu there is hope that many have survived .\", 'id': '8818b0040ed97f8251a8f20fea993ff3f3662dc0'}\n",

A bigamist caught out when his wife discovered on Facebook that he had secretly married his mistress may have been searching the internet for wife number three, it emerged yesterday. A web profile apparently matching that of ‘shameless liar’ Andrew O’Clee, 36, has been spotted on a dating site, where he claimed to be ‘looking for a relationship’. O’Clee led a double life, duping his first wife, Michelle, 39, into believing he needed to spend periods away from the family home in a ‘safe house’ because he was involved in a serious fraud trial. In reality, the former soldier was living a double life, romancing finance manager Philippa Campbell, 30, who he eventually married in a lavish wedding. His first wife uncovered his deception when she came across a Facebook video of the pair completing the ice bucket challenge – where people are filmed being drenched in cold water for charity. The post led her to photos of his second wedding, which she then reported to police. Michelle, who has been friends with singer Myleene Klass since the pair appeared in a production of Miss Saigon together in 1999, is currently seeking a divorce from O’Clee. She refused to comment yesterday, but friends said she felt ‘well and truly betrayed’ by her husband. And yesterday it emerged that the cheat may even have been looking for more women to romance after a dating profile for an ‘andrewoclee’ was uncovered on the Plenty of Fish website. Although it is unclear when the profile – which no longer includes a picture – was created, it matches his age and lists the user as living in London, where O’Clee and Michelle rented a flat.

O’Clee, of Chiddingfold, Surrey, was jailed for eight months after admitting bigamy on Tuesday. A judge, sitting at Chichester Crown Court, told business services provider O’Clee that he had created an ‘absurd lie’ which had been ‘a selfish act’. Michelle, who married O’Clee in 2008, told the court she felt ‘stupid’ and ‘naive’ but had not doubted her husband. She even failed to worry when he turned up five hours late for the birth of their daughter, Amelia. By then he was already dating Miss Campbell, who he married in August 2013 at St John the Baptist church in Kirdford, West Sussex, near their detached £575,000 home. She has vowed to stay with him.

Waheed did not fly out with his family but joined them three days later on a flight from Birmingham. Mohammed Shafiq, a friend of Waheed's father, said there were concerns about his behaviour in the months leading up to his arrest. He told Sky News: 'There were concerns in the last six months to a year about a change in his behaviour. 'And a change in his attitude towards various different issues.

All of those held are from Rochdale and are the biggest family group caught attempting to enter the unstable territory. Counter terrorism officers at Greater Manchester Police began an investigation into their movements and the extended family group were detained at a checkpoint in Ogulpinar earlier this month. A senior officer questioned why anyone would take children so young 'and vulnerable' into a warzone.

The nine Britons - four of them children – were seized by Turkish security forces as they tried to slip into Syria . Officials said they would be photographed and fingerprinted before being deported back to the UK. At the time, photographs showed Waheed, dressed in traditional robes and wearing heavy boots, leading the group from a minibus into a police station. Several women, all wearing headscarfs which covered their faces, could be seen carrying children. Most of the party were wearing walking boots, perfect for trekking across the rugged region. Shakil Ahmed, a bakery delivery driver, is a councillor in Kingsway and served alongside Karen Danczuk, wife of Rochdale MP Simon Daczuk, until her resignation in January. Speaking as he delivered election campaign leaflets earlier this month, he said he recognised his son in online newspaper reports of his arrest. He said the others arrested included Waheed's aunt, Zadia Bi, 50, and two of her sons and one of their wives. He said: 'I don't know why they have been arrested. We have no information. Until they ring we will not know what has happened.' He said that he had seen his son's photograph and when asked about one picture of his son laughing, he replied: 'Well, they went on holiday so they shouldn't be crying on holiday should they?'

It was active, with processes that resulted in different materials in different regions,' said Chris Russell from the University of California, Los Angeles. The 'alien' spots on the surface, named feature 1 and feature 5, show up in visible light images as bright flashes in comparison to the rest of Ceres's surface. In infrared, region 1 is cooler than rest of surface, but 5 is located in a region that is similar in temperature to surroundings. Last month, scientists said this pair of mysterious bright spots could be towering 'water volcanoes', but they said they need to take a closer look to confirm this. Federico Tosi, who works on Dawn's Visible and Infrared Spectrometer, presented infrared images of the two spots, measuring their thermal properties. 'What we have found is that bright spot number one corresponds to a dark spot in the thermal image,' he said at a press conference today . Captured by the Dawn probe from 28,000 miles (45,000km) away, the images reveal that two mysterious bright flashes on the surface have different thermal properties.\\xa0The upper trio is Region 1 at visible, infrared and thermal infrared wavelengths.\\xa0At thermal infrared, the spot is dark - meaning it is colder than its surroundings.\\xa0The lower trio represent Region 5. In thermal infrared, the spot disappears . Dawn observed Ceres completing one full rotation, which lasted about nine hours. The images show the full range of different crater shapes that can be found at Ceres' surface: from shallow, flattish craters to those with peaks at their centers . Ceres is the closest dwarf planet to the sun and is located in the asteroid belt, making it the only dwarf planet in the inner solar system. Ceres is the smallest of the bodies currently classified as a 'dwarf planet'.\\xa0Scientists think Ceres may have an ocean and possibly an atmosphere. It lies less than three times as far as Earth from the sun - close enough to feel the warmth of the star allowing ice to melt and reform. The Dawn spacecraft pulled into orbit last \\xa0month around the Ceres in the asteroid belt. The probe is currently on the dark side of Ceres and won't emerge until April. There is high interest in the mission because Ceres is one possible destination for human colonisation given its abundance of ice. But feature five, which appears as two separate bright spots next to each other in visible images, didn't show up in the infrared images. 'Spot number five shows no distinct thermal behaviour,' he said. Dawn is currently too far from its target to find out why this is the case, the scientists added. It may be due to having a different structure, or being made from different material. More detail will emerge after the spacecraft begins its first intensive science phase on April 23, from a distance of 8,400 miles (13,500km) from the surface, said Martin Hoffmann, investigator on the Dawn camera team. The origins of Ceres' bright spots, which have captivated the attention of scientists and the public alike, remain unknown. 'The bright spots continue to fascinate the science team, but we will have to wait until we get closer and are able to resolve them before we can determine their source,' Russell said. Recent images from the Dawn spacecraft reveal feature 5 at various angles as the asteroid rotates. The glimmers of light are visible even when they are near the edge of Ceres, suggesting that they must be high above the surface rather than at the bottom of an impact crater, as previously believed. 'What is amazing is that you can see the feature while the rim is still in the line of sight,' said Andreas Nathues, a planetary scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Göttingen, Germany. Ceres rotates in this sped-up movie comprised of images taken by Nasa's Dawn mission during its approach to the dwarf planet. The glimmers of light are visible even when they are near the edge of Ceres, suggesting that are on a high elevation in relation to the rest of the surface . The 'alien' mark can be clearly seen in images the icy world as the Dawn probe hurtled its way towards a rendezvous on March 6 . He noted that at dawn on Ceres, the spots shine brightly, but fade as dusk draws in. According to\\xa0Nature, this could mean sunlight plays an important role in the formation of the features by, for instance, heating up ice just beneath the surface and causing it blast of in a plume. Scientists have speculated that the interior of Ceres is rocky with a layer of water and ice. The leading theory now for the alien spots is that the ice is covered by a thin layer of soil that at times forms into huge 'cryovolcanoes' due to internal pressure in the asteroid. Ceres is 590 miles (950 km) across and was discovered in 1801. In January, researchers discovered that water was gushing from its surface at a rate of 13lb (6kg) per second. 'Now, finally, we have a spacecraft on the verge of unveiling this mysterious, alien world,' Dawn mission director and chief engineer Marc Rayman, of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California said. 'Soon it will reveal myriad secrets Ceres has held since the dawn of the solar system.' Ceres is the bright spot in the centre of the image. Because the dwarf planet is much brighter than the stars in the background, the camera team selected a long exposure time to make the stars visible. The long exposure made Ceres appear overexposed, and exaggerated its size A cropped, magnified view of Ceres appears in the inset image at lower left . Dawn will be captured into Ceres' orbit in March, marking the first visit to a dwarf planet by a spacecraft (artist's impression pictured) Ceres orbits the sun in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter and is very similar to Jupiter's moon Europa and Saturn's moon Enceladus - both considered potential sources for harbouring life. The presence and abundance of water in bodies like Ceres could have relevance for the origin of life on Earth and the large-scale migration of planets such as Jupiter. One scenario suggests as the giant planets migrated they disturbed populations of small rocky and icy asteroids and comets which hit the early Earth and Moon - delivering organic molecules and water to Earth. Ceres is twice the size of Saturn's geyser-spouting moon Enceladus which is suspected of having liquid water beneath its surface. It lies less than three times as far as Earth from the sun - close enough to feel the warmth of the star allowing ice to melt and reform. Since launching in 2007, Dawn has already visited Vesta, a giant protoplanet currently located 104 million miles (168 million km) away from Ceres. The distance between Vesta and Ceres is greater than the distance between the Earth and the sun. During its 14 months in orbit around Vesta, the spacecraft delivered unprecedented scientific insights, including images of its cratered surface and important clues about its geological history. Vesta and Ceres are the two most massive bodies in the main asteroid belt. Ceres is 590 miles (950 km) across and was discovered in 1801.

      "{'article': 'Ronny Deila\\xa0 has confirmed Hearts captain Danny Wilson features on a list of Celtic’s summer transfer targets. As Sportsmail revealed on Tuesday, the Scottish champions are considering a £400,000 offer for the former Rangers and Liverpool defender. Wilson has 12 months left on his current contract, with Hearts owner Ann Budge insisting the newly-promoted Edinburgh club have no need to sell. Hearts captain Danny Wilson (right) is a summer transfer target for Celtic and could be signed for £400,000 . The defender is out of contract at the end of the season but Hearts are in no rush to sell . With Celtic battling to keep hold of current pairing Virgil van Dijk and Jason Denayer, however, manager Deila admits Wilson is among the potential central-defensive reinforcements being considered. ‘He (Wilson) is one of many names we are looking at,’ the Norwegian conceded. ‘I know all about him, of course. He is a good player but there is nothing in that right now. We are looking for central defenders. That is an important target because of Jason [Denayer] and also because of the situation with Virgil. Hopefully we will keep him.’ Van Dijk has attracted the attention of Sunderland and Southampton while on-loan Denayer will return to parent club Manchester City after making his full international debut for Belgium this week. Desperate to hold on to both ahead of Champions League qualifiers which could potentially be worth £16million to the club, Deila added: ‘First of all, Virgil is our player. He will stay. That’s what we want, to have him through the Champions League. ‘He is so important to us. He still has things to work on to become even better. His chance will come in the future - but he is one of the players we really want to keep. Celtic will face a challenge to keep hold of the services of highly-rated Dutch defender\\xa0Virgil van Dijk . John Denayer is expected to return to Manchester City after an impressive loan spell in Scotland . ‘Virgil is the leader in the defence, so he is vital for us. Any money we could get for Virgil can’t compare with the money we would get from the Champions League. ‘Jason is a young player, a very good player as well. It is easy to get one player in for him, but not so much if we need two. That’s a totally different thing. I was delighted for Jason he got 30 minutes for Belgium. Again it shows to other players we are doing something right here, that he has come from not playing an important match, ever, to now playing in the first team for Belgium. That’s credit to him and for us as well.’ Repeating the view that Denayer should stay at Celtic to play European football rather than risk a return to the Manchester City reserves, Deila insisted: ‘I think it’s important for him to play, that’s why we sent Liam Henderson to Rosenborg because he needs playing time. I don’t know if he will play or not, I think he will, but it’s a very good experience for him, playing at a big club, with pressure. And the level is hopefully a little bit lower than here and he will get that experience. ‘It’s the same for Jason. City is so hard to play for, if he gets in there he is a world-class player. He is still only 20 so I think he should get more experience here. As it is now, he is going to go back to Manchester City for pre-season.’ PSV winger\\xa0Zakaria Bakkali is another target for the SPL champions and is available on a free transfer . Budge, meanwhile, insisted that Hearts’ good financial health means there would be no need for them to let Wilson go on the cheap. ‘We have been successful and there will be interest in our players and management team,’ she admitted. ‘But am I confident we can hang on to the majority of the people we currently have. ‘We are in a good bargaining position. We have a fantastic base on which to build and I hope we can hold as much of that as we can. ‘That said, it is a commercial world out there and if someone comes long and offers someone something hugely substantial, then who knows?’ As well as Wilson, Deila admitted Celtic are also trying to tie up players on pre-contract agreements. PSV Eindhoven’s Belgian winger Zakaria Bakkali is one Bosman target, Deila saying: ‘We have three players we are thinking of on Bosman but we haven’t agreed anything with anyone.’', 'highlights': 'Celtic are considering a £400,000 move for Hearts captain Danny Wilson .\\nHoops could struggle to keep hold of Virgil van Dijk while loanee John Denayer is expected to return to Manchester City .\\nScottish Championship winners claim they have no need to sell .', 'id': '7f6e91d38f2e01cf779a6671c7247343657c2d9b'}\n",

She admitted the so-called 'citizens income' – which critics say would cost £280billion – would take longer than five years to bring in, and could take even longer. Ms Bennett also admitted that another Green pledge – to dismantle the Armed Forces and use weapons factories to build wind turbines – was also a 'long-term aspiration'. The party also supports leaving Nato and abandoning nuclear weapons. The Green manual for volunteers aims to ease voters' concerns over the party's radical platform. The Green Party's surge in support has been hit by a series of disastrous media appearances from the party's leader Natalie Bennett in which she struggled to explain her key policies . Written by the party's candidate Alick Munro, who is standing in the London seat of Hayes and Harlington, the guide provides advice on responding to statements including 'You'll cause economic disaster', 'A Green vote is a wasted vote,' and 'You'll leave us defenceless.' In a section entitled 'presenting ourselves', the Green manual advises being 'open, friendly, confident, mainstream appearance, level headed, agreeable,' the Telegraph reported today. 'Bring a notebook to note down successful contacts. Stand back three feet from people's front doors so as not to appear threatening. 'Admire anything that you can reasonably admire. Take a friendly interest in people.' Canvassers are encouraged to visit car boot sales, supermarkets and sporting events, with potential Green voters identified particular among the young, the ill and public sector workers. If voters ask why they should consider voting Green, members are encouraged to say: 'We want a healthy world where people can live meaningful lives. 'We all need clean air, health food, a healthy local economy, education that brings out the best in everybody – we don't want to waste our lives sitting in traffic jams, destroying the planet and hating each other.'\", 'highlights': \"Green Party activists have been told to dress in 'mainstream' fashion .\\nA manual for the party's supporters urges them to appear 'level headed'\\nThe advice has been distributed among Green campaigners in London .\\nProvides stock answers to ease voters' concerns about their radical plans .\", 'id': 'e394a2a30957f8181dd87c5e9865280723dcfecb'}\n",
      "{'article': \"A 63-year-old former air hostess has won a £14.5m London mansion from her 'immensely wealthy' 90-year-old Saudi Arabian ex-husband following a legal battle based on a Victorian law. The property, in north west London, which has 'superb views' over a London park, was one of five properties which the successful property developer bought during the couple's 14-year marriage. The couple's main marital home had been a £26m 'palatial residence' in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, for which 40 members of staff were employed to keep it ticking over. A 63-year-old former air hostess has won a £14.5m London mansion from her 'immensely wealthy' 90-year-old Saudi Arabian ex-husband following a legal battle at the High Court (pictured) But, after their divorce, the woman - who did not have any financial input into the properties - moved into the townhouse, claiming her right to live there as one of their matrimonial homes. Despite her husband's attempts to evict her from the home, and force the sale of the heavily-mortgaged property, the wife has now been allowed to keep it as part of a complex legal settlement. The 'opulent' maisonette - which was originally three flats converted into one large home - was at one point worth £22m, but is now worth a 'disappointing' £14.5m, the court heard. The husband, who is said to be worth £600m and  blows up to £10m per year, was also made to give his wife their 'holiday' property in Cannes, which is worth 17m Euros. The judgment, made at the high court, was based on the woman's claim to a right to marital property under the 1882 Married Women’s Property Act. The judge ruled that she should be awarded around £10m on a 'needs light' basis. That was based on £3.5m for London housing, £2.25 million for a replacement holiday home and a further £500,000 to cover the outgoings on both properties. The court heard that both homes had significant mortgages, meaning they would have respective equities of £3.5m and £5.2m if they are sold. But the judge refused to grant the woman the £205,014 she was seeking annually to spend on jewellery, handbags and cars. The woman had claimed she needed £566,045 per year for her £75,000 wardrobe, as well as £25,000 to spend on jewellery. She also needed £25,000 for shoes and another £25,000 for handbags and accessories, she claimed. The couple married in the Central London Mosque (pictured) in 1979 when the man, a property developer, was in his mid-50s and the woman was in her late 20s. They divorced twice, once in 2002 and once in 2013 . The judge recognised that the woman's standard of living had been  'lavish and exceptional' during the marriage but said that it was 'not reasonable' to expect that to continue. He added: 'If the wife exceeds this figure, she will have only herself to blame.' The judge also pointed out that, had it been an entirely English case, the woman would have been entitled to £44million - the figure she originally sought - out of total £287.5million in assets. He said that even though she was 'clearly not a lady of business', she was the homemaker and mother, which made her contribution to the marriage equal to her husband. 'The authorities make it clear that she is not to be discriminated against for the way in which the parties organised their respective roles,' he said. The woman, from Lebanon, took the legal action against the businessman at the High Court in London. Had the same case been heard in Saudi Arabia, the woman would have been entitled to all but nothing. The couple married at the Central London Mosque in 1979 when the man was in his mid 50s and the woman was in her late 20s. They divorced in 1999, before remarrying in 2002. They then separated again in 2013, before divorcing in Saudi Arabia. The court heard that the main marital home had been in Saudi Arabia, where her rights would have been very different. But she was allowed to bring the case in London because the family had spent most summers during their marriage in the capital to escape the 'intolerable' Saudi Arabian heat, making it one of their matrimonial homes. Their children had also gone to nursery here during the holidays and the woman had lived here for at least one year when the case was brought. The court heard the husband owned properties in Paris, which sold for 15million Euros in 2013, and Beirut, which sold for $15.5m. His wife had kept the profit from the Paris flat, he said. Details of the case emerged in a ruling by Mr Justice Moor following a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in November. The row broke out when the pair were reunited in 2002, with the wife alleging that her husband had promised to transfer her some of his properties. The court heard that the husband, said to be a member of several London clubs, had indeed transferred different properties to other members of his family, including his wife. But the judge rejected the claim that he would have promised to transfer his wife any properties for any other reason than tax, insisting he was still the 'beneficial owner' of the property. He said: 'It is inherently improbable. He is a Saudi businessman with great stature. I cannot conceive that he would willingly part with all his residential property. Why should he? He had no intention of losing control of his various residential properties.' The judge also found that the wife had 'embellished and altered her recollection to suit her case'. The Married Women's Property Act 1882 was an act that significantly altered English law regarding the property rights of married women. Among the laws it introduced, it allowed married women to own and control property in their own right. It came following an 1836 Caroline Norton court case which highlighted the injustice of English property laws, and generated enough support that eventually resulted in the Married Women’s Property Act. Many of the elements have since been superseded by subsequent family law statutes.\", 'highlights': \"House in London was one of five properties the man -\\xa0worth £600m - owned .\\nTheir main home was £26m 'palatial' mansion in Jeddah, which had 40 staff .\\nWife now given homes in London and Cannes as part of legal settlement .\\nBut judge refused to give woman the £205,000 she wanted to spend on jewellery, handbags and cars .\", 'id': 'f19a19852542f845465dd6d54a9ffe8755a1821a'}\n",

The 72-year-old, who had worked at Bayern for almost 40 years, sensationally quit the Bundesliga club, claiming 'the bond of trust is damaged', but Guardiola has played down claims of a feud. 'The reaction is on me, I was disappointed,' he told reporters in the wake of a shock Champions League quarter-final defeat by Porto. 'It was nothing to do with the doctor.

'I've been informed of the doctor's decision and I fully respect it. Nothing happened between us, it was his decision. Injuries are part and parcel of football, they're not the medical staff's fault.'

'We have\\xa0players who were out a long time with injuries. Their legs don't last very long. It's a tough result to take into the second leg, but we'll give it a go.'

Bayern boss Guardiola looks perplexed as his side fall two goals behind during the early stages of the game . Guardiola also appeared to publicly humiliate Muller-Wohlfahrt eight days before his exit from the club, sarcastically clapping him when Benatia left the pitch injured. Continuing at his press conference on Thursday, Guardiola said: 'The responsibility for the defeat in Porto lies with me. Put together, my players have had 30 operations over the last two years, but we've still won the league and cup. 'We can't win every match 3-0 or 4-0 in this situation. It's impossible.'
